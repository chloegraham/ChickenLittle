	 * Prototype -- subject to code-breaking changes. Please use with caution.
	 * 
	 * Possible actions by player. Send through network connection using ordinal, holds key event.
	 * Any new action added here will be available to the server immediately. Make sure to add the key to the readme file.
	 * Do not overwrite any existing keys (check in the README file), Do not use CTRL or ALT at all.
	 * 
	 * INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
	 * Import the Actions enum to the class that needs to use it:
	 * 		import chickenlittle.control.Action.Actions;
	 * Use the server input to retrieve the action type. Input will be an int.
	 * Do not try to hard code in an int! Always use .ordinal()
	 * Example:
	 * 	if (Actions.NORTH.ordinal() == input){ System.out.println("Valid input"); }
	 *
